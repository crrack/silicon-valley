        <h2>Season 1</h2>

        Richard Hendricks (Thomas Middleditch) is a shy, reclusive programmer who works at a large internet company called Hooli in San Francisco. He is also developing a music player website which can certify whether your music is copyright or not, known as Pied Piper, in a live-in startup business incubator run by entrepreneur Erlich Bachman (T.J. Miller) who sold his airline aggregation software known as Aviato for millions of dollars. Hendricks sends a demo link for Pied Piper to a pair of programmers at Hooli who feign interest, and then mock him. Later, Hendricks makes a rocky post-TED elevator pitch of Pied Piper to venture capitalist Peter Gregory (Christopher Evan Welch). Within hours, however, Hooli executive Donald "Jared" Dunn (Zach Woods) and Gregory's assistant Monica (Amanda Crew) separately discover that the app contains a revolutionary data compression algorithm. This leads to a bidding war between Hooli CEO Gavin Belson (Matt Ross) and Gregory to acquire Pied Piper.
        <br>
        Hendricks chooses Gregory's offer to grow Pied Piper. He hires the residents of the incubator including Bertram Gilfoyle (Martin Starr) and Dinesh Chugtai (Kumail Nanjiani) along with Dunn, who defects from Hooli, to become the Pied Piper team. However, Hendricks' best friend Nelson "Big Head" Bighetti (Josh Brener) chooses to accept a substantial promotion at Hooli instead, having been offered it by Belson in response to Dunn's poaching, despite Big Head's obvious lack of merit for the job.
        <br>
        Hooli works to reverse engineer Pied Piper's algorithm and develops a copycat product called Nucleus. Gregory and Belson later each learn that Hendricks has been slated to present Pied Piper at TechCrunch Disrupt, a competition for unfunded startups. Belson is upset by the news, and responds by scheduling the announcement of Nucleus at the event. Hendricks explains to Monica that he meant to withdraw from the competition, but Gregory demands that the company follow through, in large part due to his rivalry with Belson. The countdown to the event means that Pied Piper has to be ready to show in less than eight weeks rather than Gregory's initial plan of five months. The team rushes to produce a feature-rich cloud storage platform based on their compression technology.
        <br>
        At the TechCrunch event, Bachman takes the lead in a dramatic onstage presentation of Pied Piper. Belson presents Nucleus, which is integrated with all of Hooli's services and has compression performance equal to Pied Piper. Watching from the audience, the Pied Piper team generally admits defeat. However, Hendricks has a new idea and spends the entire night coding. The next morning, Hendricks makes Pied Piper's final presentation and demonstrates a product that strongly outperforms Nucleus and he is mobbed by eager investors.
      </div>
      <div class="story-text" id="season-2">
        <h2>Season 2</h2>

        In the immediate aftermath of their TechCrunch Disrupt victory, multiple venture capital firms offer to finance Pied Piper's Series A round. Bachman responds to each offer by insulting each venture capital firm. Peter Gregory dies while on vacation and is replaced by Laurie Bream (Suzanne Cryer) to run Raviga Capital. Bream gives Richard the highest offer of all the VC firms: 20% equity at a $100 million valuation. Monica privately visits Richard to urge them to decline the offer, calling it a "runaway valuation that they could never live up to", which would result in diluting Series A investors in future financing rounds. Richard offers Bream the same 20% equity but at a $50 million valuation.
        <br>
        Before he can collect the $10 million, Richard finds out that Hooli is suing Pied Piper for copyright infringement, claiming that Richard developed Pied Piper's compression algorithm on Hooli time using company equipment. As a result, Raviga and all the other VC firms retract their offer. Pied Piper cannot afford the attorney's retainer to defend the lawsuit. Belson then offers to buy out Pied Piper at a higher valuation than the initial $10 million offer. Richard rejects outright claiming that he doesn't want his compression algorithm to become the property of the heartless Hooli corporation. Belson insists the lawsuit will bankrupt Pied Piper and that Richard should get something out of his company while still possible. Gilfoyle, Dinesh and Bachman reject the buyout while Monica and Jared support it.
        <br>
        As Richard is about to accept Belson's offer, he is confronted by Russ Hanneman (Chris Diamantopoulos), the wealthy man who "put radio on the Internet". Hanneman offers them $5 million despite the lawsuit and Richard turns down Hooli's buyout offer. Richard quickly begins questioning his decision after learning about Hanneman's mercurial reputation and his excessive interference in day-to-day operation. Belson meets with his litigators to discuss a strategy for the lawsuit. They decide to promote Big Head to Hooli's "moonshot" department, Hooli [xyz], to make people think he created the compression algorithm and Richard stole it to create Pied Piper.
        <br>
        When Hooli Nucleus fails to carry 4K video at a pay-per-view event, Pied Piper tries to generate publicity by live streaming a stunt for an energy drink company, Homicide. Despite a promising rollout, Erlich's past with the Homicide CEO, and issues with the stunt driver complicate matters and Pied Piper ends up quitting the job and instead live-streaming video of an unhatched condor egg. The company End Frame picks the event up for Homicide with a functioning, but lossy, 4K stream based on the Pied Piper algorithm, leaving Richard infuriated but without legal options to stop End Frame.
        <br>
        The Pied Piper team confronts End Frame about their theft of intellectual property, and End Frame brags that their large sales department will allow them to be successful despite their technical inferiority. Hanneman arranges for End Frame to buy Pied Piper, but Richard rejects the deal. Gilfoyle reveals that a post-it note with the administrator username and password he took from End Frame allowed him to retrieve sales contracts Pied Piper could use to poach End Frame's customers. Richard approaches the CEO of Intersite, a porn company with whom End Frame was negotiating a $15 million deal, and offers them a technically superior deal. The Intersite CEO proposes a "bake-off" between End Frame and Pied Piper, to see who can better compress their video data, but the competition is called off when Hanneman accidentally deletes a large portion of Intersite's video library from Intersite's servers.
        <br>
        Big Head finds a prototype Nucleus phone left behind at a bar and, stunned at how bad Nucleus really is, provides it to Richard to use as leverage against Belson. Belson agrees to drop the lawsuit in favor of binding arbitration to prevent the press from finding out about the phone. At the arbitration, Hooli's lawyers don't appear to have a real case. However, an unintentional slip by Bachman leads Hooli to realize that Richard had used a Hooli computer to run a single test of Pied Piper, meaning that per the terms of Richard's employment contract, Hooli owns the rights to Pied Piper. Hooli calls Richard as a witness and, unwilling to lie under oath, Richard admits that he used a Hooli computer. However, while reviewing Jared's contract with Hooli as part of the lawsuit, since Belson also sued for the illegal hiring of Jared from Hooli, the judge discovers that the contract has a clause that makes it unenforceable. Since Richard's contract also has this clause, along with many Hooli employees, the lawsuit is ruled in Pied Piper's favor. Thinking that they had lost Pied Piper to Hooli, Richard sends a text to the team to delete all of the Pied Piper code, but the deletion program crashes before any damage could be done.
        <br>
        Meanwhile, the museum providing the video of the condor egg decides to remove the camera due to low viewership numbers, but the technician taking it down falls and becomes trapped with the camera in a ravine. The feed of the injured technician goes viral, forcing Gilfoyle, Dinesh, Jared and Bachman to scramble to keep their servers online. Despite the high server load starting a small fire, the feed remains online until the technician is rescued.
        <br>
        After it is clear that Hooli has no claim on Pied Piper, Raviga, impressed by Pied Piper's performance during the live stream, buys out Russ Hanneman's stake in Pied Piper, securing three of Pied Piper's five board seats. However, due to the previous incidents with Intersite and Homicide, Raviga has little confidence in Pied Piper's leadership. As Pied Piper celebrates their arbitration victory, Richard is notified that the now Raviga-run board has voted to remove him from the CEO position.
      </div>
      <div class="story-text" id="season-3">
        <h2>Season 3</h2>

        After failing to convince the board of directors to keep him on as Pied Piper CEO instead of demoting him to Chief Technology Officer, Richard threatens to quit and sue to regain his intellectual property. Richard meets with a company called Flutterbeam that wants to hire him as CTO. However, after being disappointed by their work, he rejects the offer and decides to stay with Pied Piper. Afterwards, Richard meets with Jack Barker, Raviga's choice for the CEO of Pied Piper. Richard struggles under Barker's leadership, which includes spending money on extravagant offices, completely changing the business model to one that goes against the company ethos, and later forcing Richard to work on an idea that he himself came up as a poor idea to demonstrate his frustration. Eventually, when the time comes to pitch the idea to the board, Monica sides with Richard and votes against it. Subsequently, Laurie fires Jack in response to his mocking that she could do nothing to stop him, and she permits the team to commence work on the platform. The CEO position is left empty by Laurie.
        <br>
        Meanwhile, at Hooli, Gavin Belson discovers that the now invalid employment contracts would allow him to fire affected employees without severance and take back unvested stock options. Belson fires the entire Nucleus team, and uses the profits from the reclaimed stock options to offer Big Head a $20 million severance package in exchange for non-disclosure and non-disparagement agreements. The fired Nucleus team goes to work for Endframe, and manage to set up a rival product to Pied Piper, which Gavin purchases for $250 million oblivious to the fact that he is hiring back the programmers he just fired. Big Head uses his $20 million to set up his own Incubator under-cutting Erlich, so Erlich partners with him and then exploits Big Heads's lack of business savvy to take control. However, because of Big Head and Erlich's spending habits (including a multimillion-dollar Luau on Alcatraz) they declare bankruptcy, and Erlich is forced to sell his stake in Pied Piper to repay the debts. Meanwhile, after a story about Gavin scrubbing the Internet of bad press about himself is leaked by Big Head, and an attempt to steal a copy of the Pied Piper beta leads to the resignation of all of Endframe, the Hooli board of directors vote to remove him as CEO. After being removed as CEO, Gavin decides to go on a holiday to take his mind off everything. At the airport which hosts his private jet, he bumps into Jack Barker, the now-fired CEO of Pied Piper. They have a little chat, wherein Gavin incorporates Jack into his Hooli revival. Gavin now makes a new presentation in front of the board of directors. where he tells them of his "strategy" to keep up with the industry. He introduces Jack Barker as the new head of development and starts working on the "box" that Jack had set his mind to at Pied Piper.
        <br>
        After regaining his CEO position, Richard fires the staff members Jack hired and moves the company back into Erlich's house. The company hires contract engineers from around the world to help construct their application platform. Dinesh becomes attracted to one of them, a woman in Estonia, and initially she seems to reciprocate his feelings; he hacks together a superior video chat application using Pied Piper's algorithm to better pursue her, only to have her lose interest when she sees what he looks like over high-fidelity video (also revealing that she "has a boyfriend").
        <br>
        Eventually their platform reaches a point where they invite friends in the industry to test it, to universally positive reviews. The only negative response is from Monica, who says that she just doesn't understand how it works and that it seems too "engineered". She encourages Richard to trust his own instincts and release the platform if he feels it is ready, which he does.
        <br>
        After release, hundreds of thousands of people download the Pied Piper platform, leading to thoughts of a Series B funding round, and a sense of triumph when the Hooli board decides to allow it to be sold in the online Hooli Store. However, only a small fraction of the people installing the platform remain as daily active users. Focus groups investigating why this is the case reveal that Monica's instincts were correct – although it is an engineering triumph, most people do not understand how the platform works and find its design confusing and counter-intuitive. Richard decides that the best way to address this is through an outreach program to try and better explain the system, but this effort fails. Despondent, Richard expects the company to close down, but regains confidence at a sudden uptick in usership – which was due to Jared secretly employing a click farm in Bangladesh to artificially inflate usage statistics.
        <br>
        Richard soon discovers the deception and confronts Jared about it, and they agree to keep the secret to themselves, but Dinesh and Gilfoyle soon realize what is happening. Dinesh gives Richard a scrambling program which would hide the evidence in the case of an audit by future investors or regulators, which Richard seems prepared to use. Erlich, not knowing the real nature of the uptick, starts rumors about it and plays competing VCs against each other, leading to a very lucrative potential Series B funding deal from Raviga rival Coleman Blair. But before the deal is signed, Jared implores Richard not to take it, because it is based on fraud. An anxious Richard reveals the source of the uptick at the signing meeting, leading to the deal being scrapped and the company's reputation plummeting. Laurie no longer wishes for Raviga to be associated with Pied Piper and moves to sell majority control to any investor. At first the only person willing to buy seems to be Gavin Belson, who wishes to use the purchase to shut Pied Piper down permanently, but an unexpected windfall from the sale of a blog they bought while business partners leads Erlich and Big Head to buy control of the company. The original team (along with Monica, who was fired from Raviga for standing up to Laurie), having regained control, prepares to pivot again, this time to become a video chat company, based on the sudden popularity of Dinesh's video chat application which he included on the platform.
      </div>
      <div class="story-text" id="season-4">
        <h2>Season 4</h2>

        Pied Piper pivots to PiperChat and Richard steps down as CEO. Richard suggests Dinesh as the new CEO of PiperChat. Richard instead decides to create a new internet, that would be powered by a network of cell phones without any firewalls, viruses and government regulations getting in the way. Richard plans on using his compression algorithm to compress files and make the new internet more compact and easier to use. The team eventually discover that PiperChat is in violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and both PiperChat and Dinesh could be fined up to $21 billion if they're caught. Gavin Belson seizes PiperChat by threatening Dinesh with a lawsuit for intellectual property theft, despite not knowing its legal troubles. As a result of this, Gavin puts Hooli on the hook for all of the COPPA violations, and although Jack Barker said he could delete the data and shut down the app before an audit can take place, this proves to be the last straw for the Hooli board of directors, who removes Belson as CEO and expel him from the company, replacing him with Jack.
        <br>
        Richard discovers in Peter Gregory's old files that he had seen the potential in a decentralised, peer-to-peer internet back in the 1990s, but had abandoned it due to the lack of processing power at the time. Richard soon learns that the idea had been patented by Gavin Belson when he, along with Peter Gregory and others, founded Hooli. Richard is able to convince Gavin to sign over the patent and they become business partners. Richard hires Jared and Gilfoyle for the project, with Dinesh soon joining afterward. A disillusioned Gavin decides to leave Palo Alto, handing Richard full ownership of the decentralized internet patent.
        <br>
        Richard is fed up with trying to convince investors and instead goes directly to the customers, presenting the project to companies so they buy the product even if it's not built yet. After several failed meetings, FGI, an insurance company accepts their deal. Erlich inadvertently crashes into a tech meeting with Keenan Feldspar, whose VR headset is the Valley's latest sensation. Having previously failed to convince Monica and Laurie to hire him at their new VC company Bream–Hall, he uses Feldspar and his promising tech as leverage to get a job with them. Keenan Feldspar signs with Bream-Hall, but Monica and Laurie avoid hiring Erlich by giving him a generous finder's fee.
        <br>
        Richard needs to attract investment from another client due to FGI's recent surge in data processing requirements as they are responsible for the overages. Richard meets with Keenan Feldspar, even though Richard thinks VR tech is a fad. Without Richard knowing, Dinesh and Gilfoyle integrate Pied Piper's middle out compression algorithm into Feldspar's VR, which greatly improves it. As a result, Feldspar offers to acquire Pied Piper altogether. Richard doesn't want this, so he counters with an offer of $25 million, with hopes that the offer will be rejected, but Feldspar still accepts. Richard intends to concede, but Monica warns him that Feldspar's VR doesn't have future value, promising that she will fund their series A round if they can implement the decentralized internet project on a sufficient number of cell phones. After texting him telling him the deal is off, Richard learns that Feldspar has already signed with Hooli, abandoning Erlich in the process.
        <br>
        Richard decides to enter Hooli-Con, Hooli's tech conference, to put Monica's challenge into practice. The team heads to Hooli-Con with a plan to mask the Pied Piper app as the event's Wi-Fi access point using strategically placed routers, in order to get Pied Piper installed in the maximum number of phones possible. After running into his ex-girlfriend Winnie, who is presenting her boyfriend's app, Richard sabotages their laptop's screensaver, which triggers a 'tactical response team' sent by Hoover, Hooli's head of security. He tries to warn Jack Barker that Pied Piper is up to something, but is violently dismissed and threatened to be fired. After Hoover finally catches Dinesh and Gilfoyle red-handed on CCTV, he lets them go as Richard once collaborated with Gavin Belson to hinder Jack Barker's plans at Hooli and Hoover sympathizes with this. Pied Piper finally gets installed on a sufficient number of phones, which allows Richard to move all of FGI's data into the app, eliminating the need for an auxiliary data server and its related costs. Jack Barker and Keenan Feldspar present their VR mobile tech to the world, but it fails miserably and causes Hooli phones all over the auditorium to explode. Meanwhile, Erlich decides to accept Gavin Belson's invitation (originally addressed to Richard) to come and join him at a monastery in Tibet, to Belson's shock.
        <br>
        After the incident with the exploding Hooli phones, Jack Barker intends to replace all 9 million affected devices instead of releasing a firmware update. This puts Pied Piper in risk of breaching contract with FGI, as the cell phone network where the data is stored will be eliminated. Richard decides to use 'Anton', Pied Piper's server, to store the data, even if this will exceed its capacity and probably destroy it. Barker heads to China and tries to force the Hooli plant workers to increase production, but he is taken hostage until their demands are met. Gavin Belson, in Tibet, learns about this through Erlich and heads to China, rescues Barker and leaves him in Jackson Hole before being reinstated as Hooli's CEO. Meanwhile, after the broadband service at the incubator is cut due to lack of payment, Richard plans to connect Anton to Stanford Tech's mainframe, using Big Head's position there to do so. When they arrive, they discover that the back of the truck wasn't closed and Anton's parts have been scattered all over the road. When they head to FGI to face Melcher, the team finds that Anton had backed itself up to Jian-Yang's smart refrigerator, as Gilfoyle used some of the Pied Piper code when he was trying to hack it, which in turn connected itself to a network of other refrigerators like it, distributing the data and proving the decentralized internet is a working concept. Melcher attacks Richard, as he finally found out he had sex with his fiancée. Gavin Belson offers a very generous acquisition deal to Richard, who turns it down and decides to be funded by Bream–Hall. Gavin threatens to devour Pied Piper, but Richard answers back, promising to render the entire server business, and Hooli itself, obsolete.
